        <p>
        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable.

        <p>
          PHP is an HTML-embedded, server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is also used as a general purpose programming language. It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 and appeared in the market in 1995. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, C++, and Java.
        PHP codes are simply mixed with HTML codes and can be used in combination with various web frameworks. Its scripts are executed on the server. PHP code is processed by a PHP interpreter. The main goal of PHP is to allow web developer to create dynamically generated pages quickly.
